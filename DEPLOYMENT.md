# Deployment Guide

## Production Build Issues Fixed

The application has been configured to work correctly in production environments. The main fixes include:

### ✅ **Fixed Configuration Issues:**

1. **Removed problematic base path** - Fixed the `base: "./"` configuration that was causing JavaScript loading errors
2. **Updated static asset paths** - Changed to relative paths for icons and manifest
3. **Fixed build configuration** - Removed terser dependency and used default esbuild minifier
4. **Proper asset handling** - All assets now use relative paths in production

### ✅ **Current Production Build:**

- ✅ No more "Unexpected token '<'" errors
- ✅ All JavaScript and CSS files load correctly
- ✅ Static assets (icons, manifest) use relative paths
- ✅ Compatible with various hosting platforms

## Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Test the production build locally
npm run preview
```

## Deployment Options

### 1. **Static Hosting (Recommended)**

- **Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.**
- Upload the `dist/` folder contents
- No server configuration needed

### 2. **Traditional Web Server**

- **Apache, Nginx, etc.**
- Serve the `dist/` folder as static files
- Configure fallback to `index.html` for SPA routing

### 3. **CDN/Cloud Storage**

- **AWS S3, Cloudflare, etc.**
- Upload `dist/` contents to your CDN
- Configure proper MIME types

## Important Notes

### ✅ **What Works Now:**

- Location tracking and GPS functionality
- Manual data sending on rotate button click
- No automatic data transmission
- Clean user interface without status indicators
- Proper production builds

### ✅ **API Configuration:**

- Backend API calls use proxy in development
- Production should use direct API endpoints
- Update API URLs in production environment

### ✅ **Browser Compatibility:**

- Modern browsers with GPS support
- HTTPS required for location services
- Progressive Web App features included

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see "Unexpected token '<'" error:

1. Make sure you're serving the `dist/` folder contents
2. Check that your web server is configured for SPA routing
3. Verify all asset paths are accessible
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### For SPA Routing Issues:

- Configure your web server to serve `index.html` for all routes
- Example Nginx config:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

## Environment Variables

For production, you may want to set these environment variables:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - Your production API endpoint
- `VITE_APP_ENV` - Set to "production"

The application is now ready for production deployment without the JavaScript loading errors!
